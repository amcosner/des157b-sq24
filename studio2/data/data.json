    "04/15" : "Today I hung out with my housemates's cat, Mouse. She's usually a menace and always screams for attention, but today she was in the mood for a nap. I was tired and fell asleep with her on the couch (shout out to April for the picture).",
    "04/16" : "I tried to plan out a setlist for my upcoming radio show, which I failed at because I'm really picky about song transitions, the overall vibe of the set, etc. I need to embark on yet another music discovery session!",
    "04/17" : "I sat in the arboretum today and journaled! It felt nice to sit in the shade and be surrounded by birds/natural ambience. It was peaceful, aside from suffering from the most intense allergies.",
    "04/18" : "It was really hot today, so I made a frozen watermelon slushy drink with lime/mint sparkling water. I was pleasantly surprised with how this turned out!",
    "04/19" : "My housemates and I deep cleaned our blackhole of a fridge and threw out all of the stuff that was expired/forgotten about. This is the cleanest it's probably been in 2 years!",
    "04/20" : "I collect a (concerning amount of) CDs because I'm a huge nerd when it comes to CD design and I like collecting physical media for my radio show. Today I listened to some of the new CDs I bought.",
    "04/21" : "Lately I've been in a childhood-nostalgia phase, so I've been rewatching a lot of shows that I enjoyed when I was 12. Right now I'm rewatching soul eater!",
    "04/22" : "I really love collecting things, and my latest obsession has been keychains. I have an embarrassing amount and decided to organize them by color so it's easier to find the ones I want to use.",
    "04/23" : "I met up with a friend today because they wanted to give me an early birthday present. They got me this cute orange bunny keychain! I love him!!"
